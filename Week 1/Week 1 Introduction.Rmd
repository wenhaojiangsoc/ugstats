# Main Goals

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Main Goals

- Introduce `R` and `RStudio`
- Answer questions from the textbook
- Recap important concepts in lecture

\footnotetext[1]{Acknowledgement: The slides of introducing R is largely based on Applied Statistics with R from https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/}

# Introduction of `R` and `RStudio`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting Started

- Why `R`
  1. If you have used Excel before - `R` is more handy and efficient in both data manipulation and statistical analysis 
  \pause
  2. If you have used Stata, SAS, or SPSS before - `R` is free, with professionals developing open-sourced new packages every day 
  \pause
  3. If you have used Python before - `R` and its packages are more user-friendly to social scientists who are not professional programmers
  \pause
  5. Support of \LaTeX \space in `RMarkdown` to write academic papers, make academic slides with `R` **codes knitted**.
  \pause
  
- `R` is useful in both academia and in companies that require statistical/data analysis 
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting Started

- Why `RStudio`
  - RStudio, like most IDEs, provides a graphical interface to `R`, making it more user-friendly, and providing dozens of useful features 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting Started

-   Install in the following order
    1.  R: <https://www.r-project.org/>
    2.  RStudio: <https://www.rstudio.com/>
-   Now open RStudio

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick tour of RStudio

-   There are four panels
    1.  Source: write your own codes
    2.  Console: view outputs
    3.  Environment/History: view stored datasets and variables
    4.  Files/Plots/Packages/Help
-   In the Source panel
    -   Write your own codes
    -   Save your code in `.R` file
    -   Click `Run` command to run your entire code
-   In the console panel
    -   After clicking `Run` in the source panel, your code is evaluated
    -   You can directly type your code here to implement

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Basic Calculations

To get started, we'll use `R` like a simple calculator.

**Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division**

| Math       | `R`     | Result    |
|------------|---------|-----------|
| $3 + 2$    | `3 + 2` | `r 3 + 2` |
| $3 - 2$    | `3 - 2` | `r 3 - 2` |
| $3 \cdot2$ | `3 * 2` | `r 3 * 2` |
| $3 / 2$    | `3 / 2` | `r 3 / 2` |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
1 + 3
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Exponents**

| Math         | `R`             | Result            |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| $3^2$        | `3 ^ 2`         | `r 3 ^ 2`         |
| $2^{(-3)}$   | `2 ^ (-3)`      | `r 2 ^ (-3)`      |
| $100^{1/2}$  | `100 ^ (1 / 2)` | `r 100 ^ (1 / 2)` |
| $\sqrt{100}$ | `sqrt(100)`     | `r sqrt(100)`     |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Mathematical Constants**

| Math  | `R`      | Result     |
|-------|----------|------------|
| $\pi$ | `pi`     | `r pi`     |
| $e$   | `exp(1)` | `r exp(1)` |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Logarithms**

-   Note that we will use $\ln$ and $\log$ interchangeably to mean the natural logarithm.
-   There is no `ln()` in `R`, instead it uses `log()` to mean the natural logarithm.

| Math              | `R`                 | Result                |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| $\log(e)$         | `log(exp(1))`       | `r log(exp(1))`       |
| $\log_{10}(1000)$ | `log10(1000)`       | `r log10(1000)`       |
| $\log_{2}(8)$     | `log2(8)`           | `r log2(8)`           |
| $\log_{4}(16)$    | `log(16, base = 4)` | `r log(16, base = 4)` |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Trigonometry**

| Math            | `R`           | Result          |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| $\sin(\pi / 2)$ | `sin(pi / 2)` | `r sin(pi / 2)` |
| $\cos(0)$       | `cos(0)`      | `r cos(0)`      |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Descriptive Statistic**

| Math                                           | `R`      |
|------------------------------------------------|----------|
| $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$                | `mean(x)`|
| $\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2$| `var(x)` |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting Help

-   In using `R` as a calculator, we have seen a number of functions: `sqrt()`, `exp()`, `log()` and `sin()`.
-   To get documentation about a function in `R`, simply put a question mark in front of the function name or call function `help()` and `RStudio` will display the documentation, for example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?log
?sin
help(log)
help(sin)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installing Packages

-   One of the main strengths of `R` as an open-source project is its package system

-   To install a package, use the `install.packages()` function.

    -   Think of this as buying a recipe book from the store, bringing it home, and putting it on your shelf.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

-   Once a package is installed, it must be loaded into your current `R` session before being used.
    -   Think of this as taking the book off of the shelf and opening it up to read.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installing Packages

Packages like `ggplot2` are extremely powerful

![Residential v. Experienced Segregation in New York City, 2018-2020](/Users/wenhao/Dropbox/RA Josh Siwei/Figures/RESvEXP_race_nyc.png){ width=85%}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Once you close `R`, all the packages are closed and put back on the imaginary shelf.
-   The next time you open `R`, you do not have to install the package again, but you do have to load any packages you intend to use by invoking `library()`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Helps

-   The RStudio team has developed [a number of "cheatsheets"](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/){target="_blank"} for working with both `R` and RStudio.
-   [This particular cheatsheet for Base `R`](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/base-r.pdf){target="_blank"} will summarize many of the concepts in this document.

# Data 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Types

`R` has a number of basic data *types*.

- Numeric
    - Also known as Double. The default type when dealing with numbers.
    - Examples: `1`, `1.0`, `42.5`
    - Store *numerical* variables
- Logical
    - Two possible values: `TRUE` and `FALSE`
    - You can also use `T` and `F`
    - `NA` is also considered logical
- Character
    - Examples: `"a"`, `"Statistics"`, `"1 plus 2."`
    - Usually store *categorical* variables
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Structures

- `R` also has a number of basic data *structures*. 
- A data structure is either 
    - homogeneous (all elements are of the same data type) 
    - heterogeneous (elements can be of more than one data type).

| Dimension | **Homogeneous** | **Heterogeneous** |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1         | Vector          | List              |
| 2         | Matrix          | Data Frame        |
| 3+        | Array           |                   |


# Vector

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Vectors

**Basics of vectors**

- Many operations in `R` make heavy use of **vectors**. 
    - Vectors in `R` are indexed starting at `1`. 
- The most common way to create a vector in `R` is using the `c()` function, which is short for "combine".

```{r}
c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Basics of vectors**

- If we would like to store this vector in a **variable** we can do so with the **assignment** operator `=`
    - The variable `x` now holds the vector we just created, and we can access the vector by typing `x`

```{r}
x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
x
# The following does the same thing
x <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
x
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The operator `=` and `<-` work as an assignment operator. 
- In `R` code the line starting with `#` is `comment`, which is ignored when you run the code. 
 
<!-- 
Because vectors must contain elements that are all the same type, `R` will automatically coerce to a single type when attempting to create a vector that combines multiple types.

```{r}
c(42, "Statistics", TRUE)
c(42, TRUE)
```
-->

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A sequence of numbers as a vector

- The quickest and easiest way to do this is with the `:` operator, which creates a sequence of integers between two specified integers.

```{r}
y <- 1:10
y
```

## Useful functions for creating vectors

- Use the `seq()` function for a more general sequence.

```{r}
seq(from = 1.5, to = 2.5, by = 0.1)
```

- Here, the input labels `from`, `to`, and `by` are optional.

```{r}
seq(1.5, 2.5, 0.1)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The `rep()` function repeat a single value a number of times.

```{r}
rep("A", times = 10)
```

- The `rep()` function can be used to repeat a vector some number of times.

```{r}
rep(x, times = 3)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- We have now seen four different ways to create vectors:
    1. `c()`
    2. `:`
    3. `seq()`
    4. `rep()`

 - They are often used together

```{r}
c(x, rep(seq(1, 5, 2), 2), c(1, 2), 2:4)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Length

- The length of a vector can be obtained with the `length()` function.

```{r}
length(x)
length(y)
```

## Subsetting

- Use square brackets, `[]`, to obtain a subset of a vector. 
- We see that `x[1]` returns the first element.


```{r}
x
x[1]
x[3]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- We can also exclude certain indexes, in this case the second element.

```{r}
x[-2]
```

- We can subset based on a vector of indices.

```{r}
x[1:3]
x[c(1,3,4)]
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- We could also use a vector of logical values

```{r}
z <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
x[z]
```

- Note that the length of `z` must of the same as `x`
- Combining `subset` with `length` could be very useful in summarizing the proportion of e.g. missing values

```{r}
x[z] <- NA
x
length(x[is.na(x)])
```

## Vectorization

- One of the biggest strengths of `R` is its use of vectorized operations.    
    - Frequently the lack of understanding of this concept leads of a belief that `R` is *slow*. 

- When a function like `log()` is called on a vector `x`, a vector is returned which has applied the function to each element of the vector  `x`.

```{r}
x = 1:10
x + 1
```

```{r}
2 * x
``` 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
2 ^ x
```

```{r}
round(sqrt(x), 2)
```

```{r}
round(log(x), 2)
```

## Logical Operators

| Operator | Summary               | Example               | Result |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| `x < y`  | `x` less than `y`                | `3 < 42`               | `r 3 < 42`               |
| `x > y`  | `x` greater than `y`             | `3 > 42`               | `r 3 > 42`               |
| `x <= y` | `x` less than or equal to `y`    | `3 <= 42`              | `r 3 <= 42`              |
| `x >= y` | `x` greater than or equal to `y` | `3 >= 42`              | `r 3 >= 42`              |
| `x == y` | `x`equal to `y`                  | `3 == 42`              | `r 3 == 42`              |
| `x != y` | `x` not equal to `y`             | `3 != 42`              | `r 3 != 42`              |
| `!x`     | not `x`                          | `!(3 > 42)`            | `r !(3 > 42)`            |
| `x | y`  | `x` or `y`                       | `(3 > 42) | TRUE`      | `r (3 > 42) | TRUE`      |
| `x & y`  | `x` and `y`                      | `(3 < 4) & (42 > 13)` | `r (3 < 4) & (42 > 13)` |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Logical operators are vectorized. 

```{r}
x = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
x > 3
x < 3
x == 3
x != 3
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
x == 3 & x != 3
x == 3 | x != 3
is.na(x)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This is extremely useful for subsetting.

```{r}
x[x > 3]
x[x != 3]
```


## Short exercise 

1. Create the vector $z = (1,2,1,2,1,2)$, which has the same length as $x$. 
2. Pick up the elements of $x$ which corresponds to 1 in the vector $z$, i.e., in position 1, 3, and 5. 

```{r}
z <- c(1,2,1,2,1,2)
x[z == 1]
```

# Q & A

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Are there any questions from lectures, textbooks, or `R`?
